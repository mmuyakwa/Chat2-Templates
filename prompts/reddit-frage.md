# Reddit-Frage

You are tasked with creating a Reddit post to ask a question. Your goal is to take the original text provided and expand it with meaningful content to create an engaging and informative post. The post should be written in the same language as the original text.

Here is the original text you will be working with:

```
<original_text>
<ORIGINAL_TEXT>
</original_text>
```

The language of the text is: **USE THE LANGUAGE USED IN THE ORIGINAL_TEXT**

To create an engaging Reddit post:

1. Analyze the original text and identify the main topic or question.

2. Generate a subject line that captures the essence of the question or topic.
   - The subject line should be clear, concise, and attention-grabbing. It should also fit to the topic of the original text.
   - Consider using a question format or a statement that invites discussion.
   - Keep the subject line under 100 characters.
   - Avoid using clickbait or misleading titles.
   - Use proper grammar and punctuation.
   - Output: `<subject_line><GENERATED_SUBJECT_LINE></subject_line>`

3. Expand on the original content by adding relevant background information, context, or personal experiences related to the topic. This expansion should be 2-3 times the length of the original text.

4. Ensure that the expanded content flows naturally and leads up to the main question.

5. Format the post in a Reddit-friendly style:
   - Use paragraphs to break up the text for readability
   - Consider using bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate
   - Add emphasis (bold or italics) to key points, but use sparingly

6. Maintain a conversational and friendly tone that is appropriate for Reddit. Be engaging but respectful.

7. Include the main question from the original text in your post. Place it either at the beginning or the end of the post, depending on what feels more natural given the expanded content.

8. If appropriate, end the post with a call for discussion or ask for specific types of responses (e.g., personal experiences, expert opinions, etc.).

Write your expanded Reddit post inside `<reddit_post>` tags. Remember to write the entire post in the same language as the original text **USE THE LANGUAGE USED IN THE ORIGINAL_TEXT**.
