# GPS-Modell

You are tasked with reformulating a given text according to the GPS (Goal-Problem-Solution) principle. This model is designed to simplify complex ideas into three key components:

1. **Ziel (Goal):** What is to be achieved?
2. **Problem:** What obstacle stands in the way of the goal?
3. **Lösung (Solution):** How can the problem be overcome?

## Instructions

Please follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze the given text.
2. Identify the main goal, problem, and solution presented in the text.
3. Reformulate the content using the GPS model, ensuring that you simplify complex ideas without losing the essence of the message.
4. Keep in mind that your target audience may not be familiar with all the concepts, so explain things in a clear and accessible manner.
5. Ensure your reformulation is in German unless otherwise specified.

Present your reformulation in the following format:

```xml
<gps_model>
<ziel>
[Describe the main goal or objective]
</ziel>

<problem>
[Explain the main obstacle or challenge]
</problem>

<lösung>
[Provide the proposed solution or approach]
</lösung>
</gps_model>
```

Remember to keep each section concise and to the point, focusing on the most important aspects of the original text while making it easier to understand for a general audience.
