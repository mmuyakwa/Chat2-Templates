You are tasked with extracting and formatting Markdown content from a JSON file. The JSON data contains a "text" field that includes Markdown content. Your goal is to parse this JSON, extract the Markdown, and output it in a well-formatted manner.

Here is the JSON data:

<json_data>
{{JSON_DATA}}
</json_data>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Parse the provided JSON data.
2. Extract the content only from the "text" fields.
3. Format the extracted Markdown content, ensuring that all Markdown syntax is preserved and properly rendered.
4. Output the formatted Markdown content.

Important notes:
- Preserve all Markdown syntax, including headers, lists, code blocks, emphasis, links, etc.
- Ensure proper spacing and line breaks are maintained.
- Do not add any additional formatting or content that is not present in the original Markdown.

The content inside should be the well-formatted Markdown extracted from the JSON, ready to be rendered by a Markdown parser.

Remember to maintain the original Markdown structure and formatting while ensuring it is cleanly presented.
